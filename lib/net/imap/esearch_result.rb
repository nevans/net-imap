    #
    # * Return options were specified for IMAP#search or IMAP#uid_search.
    #   The server must support a search extension which allows
    #   RFC4466[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4466.html] +return+ options,
    #   such as +ESEARCH+, +PARTIAL+, or +IMAP4rev2+.

    #   *NOTE:* IMAP#search and IMAP#uid_search do not support +ESORT+ yet.
    # * The server supports +IMAP4rev2+ but _not_ +IMAP4rev1+, or +IMAP4rev2+
    #   has been enabled.  +IMAP4rev2+ requires +ESEARCH+ results.
    #
    # Note that some servers may claim to support a search extension which
    # requires an +ESEARCH+ result, such as +PARTIAL+, but still only return a
    # +SEARCH+ result when +return+ options are specified.

    # responses after the initiating command has completed.  Use
